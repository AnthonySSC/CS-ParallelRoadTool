[h1][b]Parallel Road Tool[/b][/h1]
helps you easily drawing parallel and stacked networks.

Main features are:
[list]
[*] [b]Limitless parallel/stacked configurations[/b]: you can choose [b]any network (not only roads!) and distances (both horizontal and vertical)[/b] to easily create every layout that you want
[*] [b]Visual overlay guidelines[/b] to help you visualizing what you're going to build before actually building
[*] [b]One-way networks support[/b]: you can reverse the direction of any one-way network, so that [b]you can easily build highways without needing to manually upgrade direction later[/b]
[*] Left-hand drive support
[*] [b]Upgrade mode: you can add parallel/stacked segments to already existing networks[/b]
[*] [b]Save/load presets[/b]
[/list]

[h1]For new features and/or debugging, you can subscribe to the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1400711138]beta version[/url][/h1]
[b]Tested on C:S version 1.17.0-f3[/b]

[h1]Current version: [b]3.0.4[/b][/h1]
[list]
[*] Moved mod core to Harmony for better compatibility with other mods
[*] Completely rewritten mod's core logic/engine
[*] Fully redesigned and faster UI
[*] Improved logic used to enable/disable the mod for a more consistent behavior
[*] Added button to sort networks based on their horizontal distance
[*] Added button to enable/disable automatic horizontal offset adjusting when changing the main selected network (parallel networks will be shifted to match new network's width)
[*] Added button to enable/disable automatic angle compensation: building straight networks with sharp angles can now cause nodes to be moved to produce more pleasing results
[*] Added scrollwheel support to horizontal/vertical offsets texts
[*] Pressing ALT will now switch building side (use this if upgrading curves produces unexpected results)
[*] Fixed a bug preventing trees to be applied to parallel/stacked segments

			Toggles the angle compensation feature on/off. This feature prevents segments from overlapping when creating straight roads connected using sharp angles.
			This works by moving the previous node in order to have a better angle for your parallel segments.

		[/td]
		[td]
			Toggles the auto width adjustment feature on/off. This feature automatically adjusts the horizontal offset from the main selected network everytime this changes.
			The final result is to preserve the relative distance between the original sements and the parallel ones, avoiding overlapping when selecting a larger main network.
