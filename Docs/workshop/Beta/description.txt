helps you easily drawing parallel and stacked networks.

[*] [b]Visual overlay guidelines[/b] to help you visualizing what you're going to build before actually building
[*] [b]One-way networks support[/b]: you can reverse the direction of any one-way network, so that [b]you can easily build highways without needing to manually upgrade direction later[/b]
[*] Left-hand drive support
[*] [b]Upgrade mode: you can add parallel/stacked segments to already existing networks[/b]
[*] [b]Save/load presets[/b]
